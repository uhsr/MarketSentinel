# MarketSentinel - Real-time Market Anomaly Detection

MarketSentinel is a Rust-based application designed to detect and alert on anomalies in real-time market data streams. It provides a robust and efficient platform for monitoring financial instruments, identifying unusual price movements, and triggering alerts based on configurable thresholds and statistical models. This allows for proactive risk management and opportunity identification in dynamic market environments.

This project aims to provide a highly performant and customizable anomaly detection solution for traders, analysts, and financial institutions. By leveraging Rust's speed and memory safety, MarketSentinel offers superior performance compared to traditional scripting languages, enabling it to handle large volumes of real-time data with minimal latency. The modular design allows for easy integration with various data sources and alert delivery mechanisms. Furthermore, the configurable anomaly detection algorithms provide flexibility to adapt to different market conditions and specific monitoring requirements.

MarketSentinel is built with a focus on reliability and scalability. It utilizes asynchronous programming patterns to handle concurrent data streams efficiently, ensuring timely detection of anomalies even under high-load scenarios. The system is designed to be easily deployed and managed in cloud environments, providing a cost-effective solution for continuous market monitoring. The extensive logging and monitoring capabilities provide valuable insights into the system's performance and the detected anomalies.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Processes market data streams in real-time, enabling immediate detection of anomalies. Achieved using Tokio's asynchronous runtime for non-blocking I/O operations.
*   **Configurable Anomaly Detection Algorithms:** Supports various anomaly detection algorithms, including statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, moving average) and machine learning techniques (e.g., Isolation Forest). Implemented as a trait-based system, allowing for easy addition of new algorithms.
*   **Threshold-Based Alerting:** Triggers alerts when anomaly scores exceed predefined thresholds. Configurable thresholds can be set for different financial instruments and anomaly types. The alerting system is decoupled from the detection engine for flexibility.
*   **Multiple Data Source Integration:** Supports integration with various data sources, such as WebSocket streams, REST APIs, and message queues (e.g., Kafka). Data sources are abstracted through a common interface, making it easy to add new sources.
*   **Customizable Alert Delivery:** Delivers alerts via various channels, including email, SMS, and webhook integrations. Uses the `reqwest` crate for sending HTTP requests to webhook endpoints.
*   **Historical Data Analysis:** Allows for historical data analysis to identify patterns and tune anomaly detection algorithms. Uses a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for storing and querying historical data.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Securely manages access to the system based on user roles and permissions. Implemented using a custom authorization module with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency capabilities.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust that enables efficient handling of concurrent tasks and I/O operations. Used for managing data streams and processing alerts.
*   **Reqwest:** An asynchronous HTTP client library for Rust used for sending requests to external APIs and webhook endpoints.
*   **Serde:** A serialization/deserialization framework for Rust used for handling data formats like JSON.
*   **InfluxDB (Optional):** A time-series database for storing and querying historical market data.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  Clone the MarketSentinel repository:

    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/MarketSentinel.git
3.  Navigate to the project directory:

    cd MarketSentinel
4.  Build the project:

    cargo build --release
5.  The executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## Configuration

MarketSentinel can be configured using environment variables. The following variables are supported:

*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL`: The URL of the market data stream (e.g., WebSocket endpoint).
*   `ANOMALY_THRESHOLD`: The threshold for triggering alerts (e.g., 0.95).
*   `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`: The URL of the webhook endpoint for receiving alerts.
*   `INFLUXDB_URL`: The URL of the InfluxDB instance (optional).
*   `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`: The authentication token for InfluxDB (optional).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the verbosity of the logging (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `error`).

Example usage:

DATA_SOURCE_URL=ws://example.com/marketdata ANOMALY_THRESHOLD=0.98 ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://example.com/alerts cargo run --release

## Usage

To run MarketSentinel, execute the compiled binary:

target/release/MarketSentinel

The application will connect to the configured data source, process the data stream, and trigger alerts when anomalies are detected. Detailed logging information will be printed to the console.

An example of retrieving data to feed into MarketSentinel is below. Note that this is external data and not part of the repository. Replace with your source.

use reqwest;
use serde_json::Value;

async fn get_market_data() -> Result<Value, reqwest::Error> {
let url = "https://api.example.com/market_data";

let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
let json: Value = response.json().await?;

Ok(json)
}
